## CaltechAUTHORS

[CaltechAUTHORS](https://authors.library.caltech.edu) is a repository of over 70,000 research papers authored by Caltech 
faculty and other researchers at Caltech.  The repository is large so Caltech Library makes snapshots of the 
metadata of public records and makes them available as a _dataset_collection_.  We will be use this collection
to build an index as well as extract values for querying CrossRef.

## CrossRef

CrossRef provides an web API for accessing metadata by DOI. We will use to enhance our copy of the CaltechAUTHORS
metadata.
