1. [Intro](00-intro-json-apis.html)
2. [Basic Dataset](01-basic-dataset.html)
3. [Working with Larger Amounts of Data](02-large-data.html)

## Requirements

This lesson requires basic familiarity with the bash shell, similar to the
experience gained through the
[Software Carpentry shell lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).
You'll need to have a bash shell installed, you can follow
[these instructions](https://swcarpentry.github.io/workshop-template/#setup).

Your computer will also need to have running the open source json parsing tool, jQuery, available at:
 [jq json parser](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to be able to 'pretty print' json data retrieved from API services
and dataset, a data management tool developed by Caltech Library, available 
[here](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/).
